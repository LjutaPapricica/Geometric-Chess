# Geometric-Chess
A chess made with unity engine.

* The geometric chess is a school project. Our prof decided the rules of the game. So with that I made the chess pieces changeable. You can change the type of the chess pieces whether it follows the move of the king, queen, pawn, rook and etc. But bear in mind that in the default the chess pieces are assigned with the normal moves they have in the original game of chess. Also, I forgot to add a rule for the pawn to promote to different piece.
